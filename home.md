## Introduction

This is my first Shiny app, and I wanted to use some data that isn't commonly used in R and might be a little interesting.  This is the final project for the Developing Data Products class on Coursera.

# Navigation

There are a few navigation options available within the app.

## Home

This is the Home page.

## About

This page details all of the information about the data and credits the source.

## Daily Consumption by Sex

This page renders a histogram for each category of daily alcohol consumption for each sex as selected by the user.

## Daily Consumption by Age

This page renders a histogram for each category of daily alcohol consumption for the age range selected by the user.

## Display Raw Data
