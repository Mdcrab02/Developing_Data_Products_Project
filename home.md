## Introduction

This is my first Shiny app, and I wanted to use some data that isn't commonly used in R and might be a little interesting.  This is the final project for the Developing Data Products class on Coursera.

# Navigation

There are a few navigation options available within the app.  Click on any of the links in the navigation to go to the selected page.

## Home

This is the Home page.

## About

This page details all of the information about the data and credits the source.

## Daily Consumption by Sex

This page renders a histogram for each category of daily alcohol consumption for each sex as selected by the user.  Choose "M" or "F" from the dropdown menu and the histogram will automatically update.

## Daily Consumption by Age

This page renders a histogram for each category of daily alcohol consumption for the age range selected by the user.  Select the age range by adjusting the slider bar at the top of the page and the histogram will automatically update.

## Display Raw Data

This page renders a data table of the raw data used in the app.
